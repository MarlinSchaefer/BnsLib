# BnsLib

This repository contains code to aid the application of deep learning algorithms
to gravitational-wave data analysis. It is based on PyCBC and Tensorflow and
contains useful functions to generate training data, train neural networks,
and evaluate their peormance. The main focus lies on signal detection.

The functions and classes defined in this library focus on providing an easy to
use high-performance interface. Much of this code has been used at the base of
a lot of the work I've done on deep learning gravitational-wave search
algorithms.

## Installation
Clone this git repository by running
```
git clone <link>
```
Afterwards change into the downloaded directory and and install the package via
```
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
There currently exists no real documentation for the functionality contained in
the package. I will try to add some over the coming weeks to months.
